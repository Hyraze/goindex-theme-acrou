# GoIndex-theme-acrou (Localization Repo/Dev)
This is the localization & dev fork of [goindex-theme-acrou](https://github.com/Aicirou/goindex-theme-acrou) with the support of I18n (multi-language) including English, Hindi, Kannada, Indonesian, Chinese & more to be updated..

Combining the power of [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) will allow you to index you files on the browser on Cloudflare Workers.    

[goindex/index.js](https://github.com/Hyraze/goindex-theme-acrou/go2index) is the content of the Workers script.  

This theme's goindex is currently based on [yanzai/goindex](https://github.com/yanzai/goindex/)

## About

At the beginning of this project, it was just to satisfy my personal perception and experience development. When this project reaped the first start, the first fork and the first issues, and then everyone began to make suggestions, I had the power to update. Thank you very much for your support. Now we have version 2.0.
